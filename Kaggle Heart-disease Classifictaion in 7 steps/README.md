# **Heart Disease Classification in 7 steps **
This is a kaggle competition, the goal of this project is to apply everything you have covered so far in a new context: classification of heart disease.
This competition will help introduce you to some of the differences (and the similarities) between classification problems and regression problems.
These data(train and test) come from the UCI Machine-Learning Repository (specifically from the heart-disease dataset.
## Outcome
The outcome heart_disease takes on either a 1 (heart disease is present) or 0 (not present). 
This variable is actually recoded from a variable that spanned 0 to 4, but we're going to focus on this recoding of 0/1.
Features
## The features
1. age
2. sex
3. chest_pain: type of chest pain
4. resting_bp: resting blood pressure
5. cholestoral: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. high_sugar: an indicator for whether fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. ecg: resting electrocardiographic results
8. max_rate: maximum heart rate achieved
9. exercise_angina: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. st_depression: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. vessels: number of major vessels (0â€“3) colored by flourosopy
13. thalium_scan: thalium heart scan

You can choose any Classification algorithm you want i chose Logistic Regression
I am trying to facilitate the steps of solving the problem to be easy and clear for you so i divide the problem into 7 Simple steps
